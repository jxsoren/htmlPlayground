# Getting Started with Web Development

## Step 1: Install Git

Before you can clone a repository, you need to have Git installed on your machine. If you haven't installed it yet, visit the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and download the version suitable for your operating system. Follow the instructions on the website to install it.

## Step 2: Clone a Repository

Once Git is installed, open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal app on macOS) and navigate to the folder where you want to clone the repository. To do this, use the `cd` (change directory) command. For example, if you want to move to a folder named 'Projects' on your desktop, you would type:

```bash
cd Desktop/Projects
```

Then, to clone the repository, use the `git clone` command followed by the URL of the repository you want to clone. The URL will look something like `https://github.com/username/repository.git`. For example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

This will create a copy of the repository in your 'Projects' folder.

## Step 3: Install Node.js and npm

If you don't have Node.js installed, visit the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) to download and install it. Node Package Manager (npm) is included in the installation.

## Step 4: Install http-server

Now that Node.js and npm are installed, you can install `http-server`, which is a simple zero-configuration command-line http server. To do this, use the following command:

```bash
npm install -g http-server
```

The `-g` flag installs the package globally, so you can use it from any location in your terminal.

## Step 5: Run Your Website Locally

First, navigate to your project directory (the one you just cloned). For example:

```bash
cd repository
```

Then, to start the server, run:

```bash
http-server
```

This will start the server, and you can access your website by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:8080`.

---

Remember to replace `username` and `repository` with the actual username and repository name in the GitHub URL.

Also, note that the default port for `http-server` is 8080, but if that port is already in use on your machine, `http-server` will use the next available port. Be sure to check the console output when you start `http-server` to see which port it's using.
